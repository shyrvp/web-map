			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>This map shows a general overview of the historical migration of Effutu people in Winneba, Ghana, as well as their culture based on sacred sites and deities in relationship with natural and social development. The  Effutu  culture  is  founded  on  a  rich  tradition  of  land  and  water  gods,  some  of  whom  were  accompanying  the  founding tribe as it made its way south. Other gods have been enshrined at specific sites in and around  Winneba. Taboos of everyday life were also established and while diminishing in power, continue to persist today in the everyday lives of the community. The city of Winneba recognizes 77 deities in the city, each of which is managed and protected and interpreted by a site manager. There also exists a system of traditional taboos. Interestingly, these ancient taboos reinforce the conservation approaches to the management of natural waterways and reinforce the mission of the modern Ramsar designation. 

<p>TABOOS</p>
<p>Only Effutus can fish in the lagoon.</p>
<p>Fishing is not allowed in the Ocean on Tuesdays and on Wednesdays in the Muni Lagoon. This is in respect of the Effutu who arrived to the site on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Entering the grove on certain days or removing wood for firewood fuel is prohibited.
